# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle and  created a table to insert the Spotify data into.
# I then inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table using SQLite Studio
#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.


# First I arranged the track names in order of highest popularity
SELECT popularity, track_name
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity ASC;

# Next I determined which of the most popular songs have a tempo of  over 100bpm AND have a danceability rating of over .5
SELECT popularity, 
track_name, 
tempo,
danceability FROM Spotifydata
WHERE tempo > 100 AND danceability >.5
ORDER BY popularity ASC ;

#Then  I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track.
SELECT 
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(popularity)
,avg(danceability)
,avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#I have recently acquired some skills that allow me to incorporate a CTE into my query, as listed below.
WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name,
AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData s 
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)
 
SELECT  artist_name,
        average_popularity,
        'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90;
